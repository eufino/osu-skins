<br>Repository for my personal osu skins.<br>
They **only include @2x elements** because SD elements are bloat.<br>
[Elements](source) by me are made in GIMP.
[Extras and such](extra-elements) are here<br>
They are **made for lazer** and include a MainHUDComponents.json for hud elements. <br>
Stable-only elements are not skinned and they will fall back on defaults.<br>
I have made some very simple [stable elements](stable-elements) though (not included within the skins).<br>
Having unskinned elements fall back on ArgonPro defaults instead of LegacySkin in lazer would be nice.<br>
I think it's currently not possible (i tried by editing the skininfo.json which didn't work).<br>
If i make **big** changes to one of them i'll give it a new name or version number keeping the original in tact.
